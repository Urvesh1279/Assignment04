Q1. What is MongoDB.

-> MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system.
-> It's designed to store and manage large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable manner. 
-> MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with for developers,
   especially those working with JavaScript-based technologies.

************************  features of MongoDB **********************************************

* Document-Oriented: Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for nested data
                     structures and arrays.
* Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally, meaning you can distribute data across
               multiple servers or clusters to handle large amounts of traffic and data.
* High Performance: MongoDB's architecture and features, such as indexing and sharding, enable high
                    performance for both read and write operations.

* Flexibility: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for easy adaptation to changing data structures
               and requirements, making it suitable for agile development environments.

* Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, allowing for automatic failover
                                     and data redundancy, ensuring high availability and data 
                                     durability.

* Querying: MongoDB provides powerful querying capabilities, including support for ad-hoc queries,
            indexing, aggregation pipelines, and geospatial queries.
