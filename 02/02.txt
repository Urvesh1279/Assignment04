Q2 :- What is difference between mongo DB and SQL?

SQL:-
    Represents data as tables & rows
    Must specify tables & columns
    Allows Join operations
    Utilizes structured query language
    Best for cloud-based servises

MongoDB:-
    Represents data as JSON docs.
    Don't need to declate the schema
    Doen't allow join operations
    Query language is JavaScript
    Best data security is your priority
